# Stock_Picker_solutions
The Odin Project 

Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices,
one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell.
Days start at 0.

  > stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10])
  => [1,4]  # for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
